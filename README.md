# whiskyinfo

This project is a website using open data about whiskies to display information and visualize it. It was developed solely by me as part of a university course. I used Ruby on Rails to develop the application and some JavaScript libraries + Bootstrap for Frontend. DB was PostgerSQL since that works well with deployment on Heroku.

The application can be viewed at https://whiskyinfo2.herokuapp.com (allow 30 seconds for the server to wake up)

The visual design is still a work in progress since I focused on getting the backend services and user handling right initially. If I did the project again, I would come up with an idea of the design initially, before fletching out features. In hindsight, this approach would have been smarter and would have allowed to focus on only the planned features. Also, the website would look a lot better. :-)

Since GitHub only recently enabled private repos for free, the application is hosted on BitBucket in a (now public) repo:
